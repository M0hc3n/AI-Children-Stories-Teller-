# Children's Story Generator

A lot of the time, I find myself sitting with my little cousins, obliged to read them a bedtime story. However, I often struggle to come up with a good one. To make future storytelling easier, I decided to use AI to help me out. Who knows, I might even use it for my own children someday! ðŸ˜„
